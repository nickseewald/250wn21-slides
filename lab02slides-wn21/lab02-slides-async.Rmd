# Palmer Penguins Data `r emo::ji("penguin")`
We're going to learn about some basic R functions using a data set on 333 penguins living on 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. 

.pull-left[
Data were made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research area](pal.lternet.edu), a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were prepared by [Dr. Allison Horst](github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins)
]

.pull-right[![Illustration of penguin species. Artwork by @allison_horst.](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png)
]

# "Read in" data

```{r readData}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

- The `read.csv` function takes a CSV file and imports it into R.
- What name did we give the data in R?
- Don't worry about `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` right now.

---
# View the `str`ucture of the data

```{r strPenguins}
str(penguins)
```

**IN THE CHAT:** Is `species` categorical or quantitative?

--

**IN THE CHAT:** How do you know?

---
# Frequency Tables

Use the `table()` function on a categorical variable:

```{r table}
table(penguins$species)
```

--
## What's that dollar sign (`$`)?
- You need to tell R what `data.frame` the variable is from.
- The `species` variable is *inside* the `penguins` data.

---
# Frequency Tables

You can make a two-way table by giving `table()` two arguments:

```{r twoWayTable}
table(penguins$species, penguins$island)
```

## Data is *R*eally *C*ool

Data is **R**eally **C**ool, so the first variable you give to `table()` is in the **r**ows of the table, and the second is in the **c**olumns. **ROWS, COLUMNS**
---
# Bar Charts (graphs, plots, you get it)

Let's visualize the categorical `species` variable in the `penguins` data. 

.pull-left[
```{r speciesPlot, fig.show='hide'}
barplot(table(penguins$species),
     xlab = "Species",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Bar Chart of Number of Penguins of Each Species Observed",
     col = c("darkorange1", "mediumorchid2", "darkcyan"))
```

- `xlab`: x-axis label
- `ylab`: y-axis label
- `main`: plot title
- `col`: colors
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("speciesPlot", "png")`)
]

# Penguins Data

```{r strPenguins}
```

**IN THE CHAT:** Is `flipper_length_mm`categorical or quantitative?

--

**IN THE CHAT:** How do you know?

---
# Numerical Summaries

```{r flipperSummaries}
summary(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```

- `Min.`: minimum (shortest) flipper length
- `1st Qu.`: first quartile flipper length
- `Median`: median flipper length
- `Mean`: mean flipper length
- `3rd Qu.`: third quartile flipper length
- `Max.`: maximum (longest) flipper length

---
# Numerical Summaries

You can always get just the one summary you're looking for by using the specific function:

.pull-left[
```{r summaryFunctions1, error = T}
min(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
median(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r summaryFunctions2, error = T}
max(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
sd(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
IQR(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```
]

---
# Boxplots

.pull-left[
```{r boxplot, fig.show='hide'}
boxplot(penguins$flipper_length_mm,
        main = "Boxplot of Penguin Flipper Length",
        ylab = "Flipper Length (mm)")
```
]
.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("boxplot", "png")`)
]

---
# Histograms

.pull-left[
```{r hist, fig.show = 'hide'}
hist(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
```

{{content}}
]

.pull-right[
![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("hist", "png")`)
]

--
Those are some terrible axis labels, huh?

Fix them with `main` and `xlab`!

---
# Histograms

.pull-left[
```{r histLabels, fig.show='hide'}
hist(penguins$flipper_length_mm,
     main = "Histogram of Penguin Flipper Length", #<<
     xlab = "Flipper Length (mm)") #<<
```

]
